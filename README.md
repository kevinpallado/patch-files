### Steps to solve this problem

1. Since I am not familiar with the error specially it involves with frontend setup I need to research for the problem "syntax error 'import' and 'export' may appear only with 'sourceType: module'" first thing comes to my mind is it involves how the syntax written for the file "app.css" I checked my previous projects for reference and compare and see how the my old project setup and this current problem setup.

2. Second since the first solution not working I try to deep understand the problem since it is not the syntax problem, I suspect it is coming from vite config as running the "dev" mode is working only in build is having the problem.

    I stumble upon this issues in [github](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/9029) regarding vite specific problem, renaming it with .cjs, .mjs as what on the discussion is not the ideal solution

    Removing of "postcss.config.js" the problem is solved but it has warning pop up right after the build

    On this moment I really know that there was a problem with postcss since removing it will solved the problem but I think its not an ideal answer.

3. Lastly I found this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70728985/vite-does-not-build-tailwind-css) and this [github](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense/issues/399) problems that lead me to the answer adding css configuration and apply postcss for plugins in tailwind

```
css: {
        postcss: {
            plugins: [
                tailwindcss(tailwindConfig)
            ],
        },
    },
```
